#Intel DevKit

With the new Intel DevKit there is more support for packages like Vim, Nano, pip, IoTivity, etc. Ostro is the new project for Edison, like Yocto evolved. However; there is only available the files required to install it through a script, not modifying and compiling the kernel, the URL where the files are supposed to be is broken.


There is no such thing as Yocto 3.0 for the Intel Edison, the Intel IoT devkit is in version 3.0.
