Ostro is the new project for Edison, like Yocto evolved. There is no such thing as Yocto 3.0, the Intel IoT devkit is in version 3.0 but the only changes in this release are the software that is out of the box, for example vim, nano, pip, etc. 

So, Ostro is the new OS for these platforms, it supports Intel Edison, Intel i7-64 and Intel Quark.

To install Ostro...

Dependencies:
sudo apt-get install dfu-util
tar -xvf xfstk-dldr-linux-source-1.8.1.tar.gz 
sudo apt-get instlal cmake
sudo apt-get install qt4-default
QT5 is not supported by xfstk
